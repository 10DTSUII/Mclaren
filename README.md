### Original idea
  An original idea i had for the website was the gallery page.My previous intention was to make a gallery with a reflective
  ###Original idea -Anime to Mclaren
  ### Homepage
  My homepage is a simple introduction to the product with a video and a custom animated title.
  ### My Design Process
  ## Layout
  -VIDEO
    - The video background of my homepage was take from youtube and converted from youtube and converted to a mp4 file.After converting to mp4 i procceded to download the file to my folders prior to implementing the video in my website.

 ### All Pages
 The Fav icon is the Mclaren logo- (On all pages <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href ="/images/logo.ico")
 All pages have a black backround. (.container = bacground color:black;)
 All pages have a link to the tereo maori and english version of each.
 All pages have a nav that once hovered over will have a red line go from the left to the
 when its being hovered over.
 Every nav excluding the homepage nav is in the center.This is because of the video.
                   
                                                       
                                                       
   ### Homepage /DT Assessment/WEB/Homepage.html
  The homepage is the most minamilistic webpage with a video in the middle.The nav for the homepage is located further to the right than other pages because if   it was located in the center it would be to close to the video and the mclaren title ascending form the below.The homepage video was converted from youtube    to a online mp4 converter.It was then downloaded as an mp4 and used in this video to introduce the Mclaren Supercar.This video is an integral part of the        website as the asthetic design, the placement and quality allow it to set the black minamilistic theme for the rest of the website and draw the viewer in.THe video is set to auto play in a muted loop.The mclaren title h1 welcome text.The text ascends from below the the view of the website through the translation of the y axis.The website is a transparent red while floating up, but is black once you hover over it.
  


  ### Gallery /DT Assessment/WEB/Gallery.html
   The gallery page is minimilastic like every other page with only the navigations and images on the page.The gallery is set in a 3x4
   format with 3 rows of images and 4 columns.Once you click on an image, through the animations and effects developed through the lightbox it eaises in  from
  above the view of the webapge and floates down from the top.Futhermore, once you hover over an image it lights up , brighter than the rest of the images.Once 
    you click on an image, it enlarges and fills most of the page allowing you to get a closer view at the image.
                                                       -through the light box the image transitons and easis in from above at 1.2 seconds and alligns in the center
 
 
 ### About   /DT Assessment/WEB/About.html
 The about page along with the rest of the website is minamilistic, with just a paragraph of text on the right side of the website and an innovation picture on
 the left side.The color of the text is white, the color is white because it contrasts the otherwise black backgound and draws the attention of the viewer
  towards it.There is a about mclaren title above the text and picture, the h1 title is in the .container .content -section div.The text is found in the .container . content div, the purpose of the text was to briefly discuss Mclarens racing history.The webage also displays gliphys with a direct link to Mclarens social media pages.For instance, Mclarens twitter, instagram and facebook pages.The gliphcons are under the social div and are displayed directly below the text.They are presented in the color red, and once you hover them are gray. This was an intentional aspect of design as it works well with the color themes of the website.
 
 ### Contact /DT Assessment/WEB/Contact.html
  The contact page has a contact form and a map to the mclaren retailer in Auckland.The form and map are both within the contact box div.
   The backgorund of the form was picked to be white because it drew the attention of the viewer from the rest of the black background.
   When you hover over the different inputs (Name, Email, Subject and Message)the color red will appear.When you click send after submitting your form 
   It will display a message alerting you to your submission and will refresh the page.
  The contact box div is displayed as a grid, with 2 columns.Namely,the map taking 2/3 of the 950 px contact box and the form taking 1/3 of the 950 px div.
  The map is rather large being 633.33 px, with the map you are able to zoom into the map and view the surrounding areas and the rest of the globe if you wish     to seek other Mclaren retailers.If you wish to translate the page to maori, hover over the blue colored language navigation and the option to change language will appear.
  
  
 ### Justification
 Firstly, my justification as to why I chose to produce a minimalistic website is that a minimalistic website drastically reduces clutter which allows viewers to focus on important information. In a website with a vast amount of text viewers find it difficult to grasp the content and may miss important information due to the substantial amount of text in front of them.However, a minimalistic website deters confusion and allows the viewer to get the information they desire.
 
Secondly,another reason as to why i chose a minimalistic website is that less complexity means fewer problems.Rather than spending hours trying to figure out how one to fix one little mishap, a minimalistic website is easier to understand making it easier to fix.Which is in direct contrast to a website with an abundance of code where trying to fix one error requires a lot of effort and time.
 
Thirdly, another reason as to why i chose to produce a minimalistic website is how visually striking it is.If you have a website with conflicting colors and text here and there, it is easy to overlook the little details.However, the minimalist website draws the viewer in through its minimalist design.For instance having one color around various elements acts as a guide for the viewers visual flow and places emphasis on certain elements.

 Lastly, the product.By having a minimalistic website the product is drawn out.For instance, the aesthetic design of the Mclaren sends the message to the reader that this car is a luxury high supercar.This makes it so i don't have to write that much text because the Mclaren car speaks for itself.

### Issues I faced with the coding aspect of the website
