### Original idea

Here i will list original concepts and ideas i had that i wanted to implement in my website and my reasoning as to why i didn't progress any further:
Anime- In the beginning i wanted to develop an anime website, this would feature my favorite characters , my favorite fights, my favorite shows and
what i recommended to the viewer.However, i discarded this idea earlier in the term after i had learned the intended purpose of developing this website 
which was to showcase a product, service or event.So i discarded my former project because this did not lie in the interests of the stakeholders.


Gallery- In the beginning earlier in the term i wanted to create a rotating gallery, i managed to make the gallery rotate however, i only realized the problems
with the rotating gallery only after i had finished it.This issues were: The website would appear vertically on the left side of the page going down, then the
page would turn black and the desired horizontal rotating gallery would appear.Futhermore, the images were too far up, being too close to the navigations.
Moreover, the major reason as to why i reverted back to my old gallery is because of the quality of the images when they were expanded.The quality was 
atrocious and because distorted images are hard to see and don't appeal to others.

 
 ### -Responsiveness
 initial scale provides responsiveness with the viewport initial-scale=1.0
  
  
  
  ### Layout
  Placement.The placement of my video for the homepage is in the center.The placement of the nav buttons were in the center.The exception being the homepage
  where it was on the right to give space between the video and the hover over of the language.The language button in the color blue was right next to the 
  other nav buttons.The one difference being, instead of underlining red when you hover over it, it would display a block where you would be given the option 
  to change languages.The website is originally presented in english, If you wish to change languages and click on reo that page will change to the reo
  html and everything will be translated to Maori, as well as the navigations.
  Color is an element in coding.The colors i used were in accordance with the design of the website to create a certain effect.The colors i used:
 
 
 Red, red was used in my website in instances such as when you hover over the nav menus (HOME GALLERY ABOUT CONTACT) a red underline would appear from
 the left and transition to the right.The color red is also prevalent under the contact us title on the contact page.Furthermore, the color red also appears
 when you hover over the input types on the contact page.
  
  Black is set as the background of every single page.This is to provide a minimalistic page and guide the viewer to other elements on the page that 
  directly contrast the color of black such as white.
  
  White - the color background of the contact form is white because this grabs the viewers attention as it is the complete opposite of the otherwise fully black 
  background.White is also used in the navigation menu fonts to clearly show the viewer that this is how you visit other pages.It is also used for the color of
  text in the about page because it directly contrasts black.Futhermore, the color white appears once you hover over images on the gallery.
  
  Blue- My reasoning as to why i used the color blue just for the languages is because it looks different to the other navigation menus so the reader will 
  notice this odd menu and realize it gives you the option to change languages when you hover over it.
  
### Extra stuff

 **The Fav icon is the Mclaren logo- (On all pages <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href ="/images/logo.ico")**
  Light box is used in the gallery to give the viewers a way to enlarge the image without impairing the quality of the picture.

                   
                                                       
                                                       
                                                        ### Homepage /DT Assessment/WEB/Homepage.html
  
  The homepage is the most minimalistic web page with a video in the middle.The nav for the homepage is located further to the right than other pages because if
 it was located in the center it would be too close to the video and the mclaren title ascending form the below.The homepage video was converted from youtube  
  to a online mp4 converter.It was then downloaded as an mp4 and used in this video to introduce the Mclaren Supercar.This video is an integral part of the
  website as the aesthetic design, the placement and quality allow it to set the black minimalistic theme for the rest of the website and draw the viewer in.The 
 video is set to auto play in a muted loop.The mclaren title h1 welcome text.The text ascends from below the the view of the website through the translation
  of the y axis.The website is a transparent red while floating up, but is black once you hover over it.
  


  ### Gallery /DT Assessment/WEB/Gallery.html
   The gallery page is minimalistic like every other page with only the navigations and images on the page.The gallery is set in a 3x4  format with 3 rows of images and 4 columns.Once you click on an image, through the animations and effects developed through the lightbox it eases in  from  above the view of the webpage and floats down from the top.Furthermore, once you hover over an image it lights up , brighter than the rest of the images.Once you click on an image, it enlarges and fills most of the page allowing you to get a closer view at the image.  -Through the light box the image transitions and eases in from above at 1.2 seconds and aligns in the center
 
 
 ### About   /DT Assessment/WEB/About.html
 The about page along with the rest of the website is minimalistic, with just a paragraph of text on the right side of the website and an innovation picture on
 the left side.The color of the text is white, the color is white because it contrasts the otherwise black background and draws the attention of the viewer
 towards it.There is a about mclaren title above the text and picture, the h1 title is in the .container .content -section div.The text is found in the .container . content div, the purpose of the text was to briefly discuss Mclarens racing history.The web page also displays glyphis with a direct link to Mclarens social media pages.For instance, Mclarens twitter, instagram and facebook pages.The gliphcons are under the social div and are displayed directly below the text.They are presented in the color red, and once you hoover them are gray. This was an intentional aspect of design as it works well with the color themes of the website.
 
 ### Contact /DT Assessment/WEB/Contact.html
  The contact page has a contact form and a map to the mclaren retailer in Auckland.The form and map are both within the contact box div.
   The background of the form was picked to be white because it drew the attention of the viewer from the rest of the black background.
   When you hover over the different inputs (Name, Email, Subject and Message)the color red will appear.When you click send after submitting your form 
   It will display a message alerting you to your submission and will refresh the page.
  The contact box div is displayed as a grid, with 2 columns.Namely,the map taking 2/3 of the 950 px contact box and the form taking 1/3 of the 950 px div.
  The map is rather large being 633.33 px, with the map you are able to zoom into the map and view the surrounding areas and the rest of the globe if you wish     to seek other Mclaren retailers.If you wish to translate the page to maori, hover over the blue colored language navigation and the option to change language will appear.
  
  
 ### Justification
 Firstly, my justification as to why I chose to produce a minimalistic website is that a minimalistic website drastically reduces clutter which allows viewers to focus on important information. In a website with a vast amount of text viewers find it difficult to grasp the content and may miss important information due to the substantial amount of text in front of them.However, a minimalistic website deters confusion and allows the viewer to get the information they desire.
 
Secondly,another reason as to why i chose a minimalistic website is that less complexity means fewer problems.Rather than spending hours trying to figure out how one to fix one little mishap, a minimalistic website is easier to understand making it easier to fix.Which is in direct contrast to a website with an abundance of code where trying to fix one error requires a lot of effort and time.
 
Thirdly, another reason as to why i chose to produce a minimalistic website is how visually striking it is.If you have a website with conflicting colors and text here and there, it is easy to overlook the little details.However, the minimalist website draws the viewer in through its minimalist design.For instance having one color around various elements acts as a guide for the viewers visual flow and places emphasis on certain elements.

 Lastly, the product.By having a minimalistic website the product is drawn out.For instance, the aesthetic design of the Mclaren sends the message to the reader that this car is a luxury high supercar.This makes it so i don't have to write that much text because the Mclaren car speaks for itself.
