                <div class="item3"><p>Since the formation of McLaren Racing in 1963, McLaren has been pioneering and innovating in the competitive world
                    of Formula 1,forging a formidable reputation which has seen the racing team win 20 World Championships and over
                    180 races.The Group has built on its successful racing expertise  and diversified to include a global, 
                    high-performance sports car business,McLaren Automotive , and a game-changing technology and innovation business,
                    McLaren Applied .Despite the broadening of the group’s business interests,McLaren’s goal remains singular:<b>We exist to win in everything we do.</b> </p>

                    <p>Innovation resides at the heart of the McLaren Group. Competing in the most technologically advanced racing series 
                    in the world requires dedication, creativity and a microscopic attention to detail. In Formula 1, if you’re not innovating
                    you’re going backwards.McLaren Racing formulates and delivers an upgrade to the McLaren MCL35M every 17 minutes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and analyses 6.5 billion pieces of data from both cars over a race to work out where  <br>
                    further improvements may lie.The relentless rate of development needed to remain at the pinnacle of motorsport has
                    become second nature to a company that has been competing for over 50 years, and is now seeded into every  
                    McLaren activity.Indeed, pioneering discovery and honing applications - the day-to-day stock-in-trade of 
                    the Group - are also delivering real-world benefits outside of motor racing.
                    McLaren Applied harnesses the innovative technologies developed from decades of elite competition in Formula 1, and
                    applies it to industries as diverse as health, public transport, automotive and motorsport!</p></div>
